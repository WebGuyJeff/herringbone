                        As a web designer, I deal with the research and idea stages of
                        a development project. Working with stakeholders through a structured
                        process to combine research data, branding and project goals to produce
                        visual blueprints of the final product. Every aspect of the target-users
                        needs must be considered to successfully inform the designs.

                        As a web developer, I write website and web app core systems. 
                        Coding with an array of web programming languages, the components
                        required to serve content and functionality are constructed. I 
                        engineer a web hosting environment to serve the website and manage
                        site traffic, security and performance. The front end is built and
                        styled with a continuous develop and test cycle to ensure the interface
                        is on-spec with the intended experience.

                        WordPress is the worlds number one website platform which as of January 2022
                        powers 43% 
                        <sup class="reference">

                                [1]
                            </a> 
                        </sup>
                        of all websites! It&apos;s a versatile and user-friendly platform that was
                        originally built for blogging but now powers everything from e-commerce to
                        social media platforms. The real power of WordPress is in its infinite
                        potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With WordPress I can quickly launch a website with the aid of existing
                        themes and plugins. If you have big ideas but a tight budget, we can achieve
                        great results by off-setting development time with these existing building
                        blocks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WordPress provides a great content managment system (CMS) core, giving
                        website owners infinite control to create and manage the content of their
                        website. I can build a bespoke 'backend' to manage any type of content you
                        may want to publish to your website, whether it be a blog post, a product
                        or a property listing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For large projects, your requirements are the limit, and if it appears
                        WordPress may not be the best fit for your needs, no problem! While I
                        love WordPress, I&apos;m a platform-agnostic developer and will ensure your
                        website or web app is launched on the best platform for the job. Even if
                        that solution is no existing platform at all and we code from scratch.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Whether building from scratch, or improving the performance of an existing
                        site, search engine optimisation (SEO) is a vital consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way a website is presented to search engines determines how a search
                        engine such as Google or Bing, ranks your website in its search results.
                        It doesn't matter if you have pages and pages of juicy content if your
                        potential customers aren't being shown your website when they search for
                        services you might provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By comparing your goals with the market landscape and the measured SEO
                        performance of any existing sites, I compile an SEO plan to push your
                        website under the noses of search engine users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here I can either provide a report for your consideration, or perform
                        all changes on your behalf. This will likely involve improvements to your
                        website template markup (code), your content both written and visual and
                        other domain-affecting assets e.g. email campaigns.

                    <p>
                        As a digital marketer, I leverage web-based channels and search engine
                        optimisation to help spread a message. Starting from the ground up,
                        web pages are coded with semantically logical structure, meaningful
                        linking and adoption of the Open Graph protocol for rich social media
                        integration. I perform AND implement full technical SEO audits on
                        existing sites. Paid advertising is used across Google, Bing, and
                        social platforms to maximise outreach while organic content gains
                        traction.
