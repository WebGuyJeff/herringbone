		<h2>Why Your Business Needs a Website No Matter What Industry You’re In.</h2>
		<p>Big business decisions are made in seconds based on the first impression of a website. It doesn’t matter if you operate a chain of gyms or sell sculptures from your garage; Your digital game is making and breaking business opportunities for you right now.</p>
		<p>Your online presence is critical if you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Operate a business of any size
			</li>
			<li>
				Sell services or products in any capacity
			</li>
			<li>
				Maintain a personal reputation as a professional (freelancer or self-employed)
			</li>
			<li>
				Promote a non-profit message or service
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A website isn’t something that can fill a gap overnight, it takes time and work to establish a presence and become the driving force of your brand and business opportunities. As customers get to know you and your business, they share links to your website by posting pictures of what you do and talking about your work on social platforms. This traction builds your customer following and turns an idea or startup into a successful enterprise.</p>
		<p>This is why it’s key to set sail with a professional website as early as possible, even if the website is basic, to begin with. To plant your flag means your customers have somewhere to send their friends and followers. Otherwise, all those great reviews and word of mouth you’re generating, lead to nothing.</p>
		<p>If you think you’re too small to warrant a professional website, remember that a website is an automated workforce. Not only is it able to represent you and answer questions 24/7, having the right content and information reduces the repetitive phone calls and emails about your service that distract you from being more productive.</p>
		<p>Finally, your website generates new leads. A website is one element of your business that should always generate a positive ROI and when done correctly, it’s a sure investment in growth. If you had just one extra job per week, what would that mean over a year?</p>
