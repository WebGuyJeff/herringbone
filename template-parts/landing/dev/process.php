    <h2>The Website Building Process</h2>
    <p>You don’t need to know anything about websites to work with me as I guide you through the entire process explaining everything in plain English. I take the time to learn about your ambition, the target audience and the competitive landscape to design a well-informed website which we will continue to build and develop as your business grows.</p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>I’ll look at the competitive landscape to establish context and benchmarks for how your site should function. This stage is about compiling market research and analysing data that will inform the design and search engine optimisation of the website.</p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>I’ll set to work sketching out interface layouts and wireframes which look like skeletons of your website without the visual polish of the final design. This allows me to experiment and iterate on solutions quickly to optimise a layout to work across different screen sizes. Next, I’ll design visualizations showing what the final design will look like so we can commit to a plan for the development stage. In the design phase, I will submit wireframes and subsequently, the final designs for your approval at each stage. I use my expertise to inform the performance and user experience aspects of the design and your input allows us to dial in the look and feel to keep branding on point. For the final designs, I normally limit the process to two rounds of revisions to keep the process from getting stuck in a loop of changes. This doesn’t mean you’ll be put on the spot to make major decisions quickly, I always make sure my clients are happy before we move onto development.</p>
    <h3>Develop</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve approved the design, I’ll start building using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will be based upon the WordPress platform allowing us a speedy and budget-friendly implementation as I can overlay the website design upon the existing framework. This process involves installing an existing WordPress theme that will be modified to suit our needs. This platform also provides a modern, user-friendly interface for you to administer from when you want to add or change website content such as service items.</p>
    <h3>Deploy</h3>
    <p>Now the exciting part! After testing the site in a development environment across different browsers and devices and addressing any bugs that arise, a new server will be configured and booted in the hosting environment. Once the domain name and DNS have been configured, the new website is mirrored to a production environment and launched into a live state ready for business. It’s at this point we ‘cut the ribbon’ and your new website will begin to be crawled by search engines and be discoverable by the world. In these early stages, I closely monitor and continue testing the new website to make sure everything is working as expected. This is also the stage where I hand over the keys and give you a training induction to the new website admin area. I’ve done this many ways in the past, over a video call, face to face at a laptop and in some cases simply provided a written guide. Whatever works for you.</p>
    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>Now that ‘phase one of the website is complete, I provide ongoing support as part of my hosting and domain package performing routine maintenance and updates. On top of this housekeeping, I also monitor SEO (Search Engine Performance) and can make suggestions on areas of improvement and further development which will support your business needs.</p>
    <p>For any queries or problems, I have a ticketing system you can use to log issues or simply contact me by phone or email. Support for issues and general queries regarding your website is included in the price of the hosting package, while any extended support for issues stemming from factors external to the new website or hosting services may be chargeable.</p>
    <p>Please note, you’ll never receive surprise invoices from me and I don’t discourage anybody from calling for any reason even if it’s just to chat!</p>
    <h4>PLANET-FRIENDLY</h4>
    <p>I’m proud to say that my hosting servers are based in London as part of the first independent hosting network powered by 100% renewable energy. This means no harm is done to the planet by the running of your new website.</p>
