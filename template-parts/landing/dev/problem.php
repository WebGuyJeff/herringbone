		<h2>The Troubles with Getting a Small Business Website</h2>
		<p>Choosing a web design company and the right web hosting services are up there with the most confusing decisions a business owner has to make. They often don’t know what managing a website entails and assume it’s beyond their technical know-how. They also may not be aware of the benefits a website is capable of bringing to a business, beyond simply existing as a web address on their stationary.</p>
		<h3>How much should you spend on a small business website?</h3>
		<p>Web agencies of different sizes quote an equally differing range of prices whilst freelancer comparison websites compete with cut-throat fixed rates that seem too good to ignore. For the budget conscious, DIY business website builders are the low-hanging shiny apples of the website industry.</p>
		<h3>How do you get a small business website?</h3>
		<p>Do you hire a web designer, web developer, or a whole website agency? What are the differences and what are the pieces that make up a website in the first place?! Terminology and titles are used interchangeably across the web making learning a minefield for outsiders.</p>
		<h3>My current website is OK it just needs updating</h3>
		<p>If I had a pound…</p>
		<p>I’m willing to bet this has been the case for a considerable length of time and while it’s true the logo and imagery should be kept up to date, there is almost always a list of vital technical improvements that should be made ASAP.</p>
		<h3>Do I need a small business website?</h3>
		<p>Hopefully it hasn’t come to this, but if this question has crossed your mind, the answer is a hard yes. If you have a business that serves, supplies or engages with people in any way, you’ve met the criteria. If you’re a solo professional or just considering the benefits of being your own boss, you’ll be glad you took the initiative to establish your personal reputation, especially when you eventually part ways with that large company.</p>
