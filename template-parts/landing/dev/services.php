                    <p>
                        As a web designer, I deal with the research and idea stages of
                        a development project. Working with stakeholders through a structured
                        process to combine research data, branding and project goals to produce
                        visual blueprints of the final product. Every aspect of the target-users
                        needs must be considered to successfully inform the designs.

                    <p>
                        As a web developer, I write website and web app core systems. 
                        Coding with an array of web programming languages, the components
                        required to serve content and functionality are constructed. I 
                        engineer a web hosting environment to serve the website and manage
                        site traffic, security and performance. The front end is built and
                        styled with a continuous develop and test cycle to ensure the interface
                        is on-spec with the intended experience.

                        Search Engine Optimisation
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Whether building from scratch, or improving the performance of an existing
                        site, search engine optimisation (SEO) is a vital consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way a website is presented to search engines determines how a search
                        engine such as Google or Bing, ranks your website in its search results.
                        It doesn't matter if you have pages and pages of juicy content if your
                        potential customers aren't being shown your website when they search for
                        services you might provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By comparing your goals with the market landscape and the measured SEO
                        performance of any existing sites, I compile an SEO plan to push your
                        website under the noses of search engine users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here I can either provide a report for your consideration, or perform
                        all changes on your behalf. This will likely involve improvements to your
                        website template markup (code), your content both written and visual and
                        other domain-affecting assets e.g. email campaigns.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        As a digital marketer, I leverage web-based channels and search engine
                        optimisation to help spread a message. Starting from the ground up,
                        web pages are coded with semantically logical structure, meaningful
                        linking and adoption of the Open Graph protocol for rich social media
                        integration. I perform AND implement full technical SEO audits on
                        existing sites. Paid advertising is used across Google, Bing, and
                        social platforms to maximise outreach while organic content gains
                        traction.
