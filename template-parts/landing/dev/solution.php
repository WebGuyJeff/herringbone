		<h2>Web Development for a Small Business</h2>
		<p>Having worked closely with many business owners experiencing technological hardships as both employee and consultant, solving website and cloud service (such as email) problems has become my speciality.</p>
		<p>
		<b>Yes – I build/rebuild websites</b> from start to finish with a thorough research and design process that means you have a professional website tailored to your businesses and brand needs, and yes I cover just about any web-based development you can find a problem for. <span>The difference</span> between me and almost any other website pros you’ll possibly end up hiring is that I make the big company in-house website ecosystem available to small businesses and startups.
		</p>
		<h3>I Engage Your Customers</h3>
		<p>I build a mobile-first website using responsive design to represent your brand, engage your audience and generate leads from the customers you want to serve. By learning about your industry, site function and features are well-informed, giving you the edge over your competition. Say goodbye to DIY website templates.</p>
		<h3>I Empower Small Businesses</h3>
		<p>I implement a content management system to make editing your website simpler than using Facebook and can even be done from an app on your phone. Up-to-date information gives customers 24/7 access to answers they need reducing the number of distracting phone calls and emails. Fresh content, even just occasional photos of your latest work, will keep your customers engaged and improve your search engine rankings. You have advertising in your pocket!</p>
		<h3>I Grow Small Businesses</h3>
		<p>I make the continuous development life-cycle accessible to small businesses. With a professionally built website, expansive development can be segmented into bitesize chunks to suit your cash flow, growing the website with your business and customer needs.</p>
		<h3>I Make Small Business Easier</h3>
		<p>I manage all the technical elements of the website, hosting, emails and other cloud services to take these concerns away from the daily running of your business. I can even adopt an existing site with a support plan providing advice on digital next steps to grow your business.</p>
