                    What does a <span class="hardy">website developer</span> do?
                </h2>
            </header>


            <p>
                A web developer is tasked with creating website and web app core
                functionality coding with an array of  web programming languages.
                They engineer a web hosting environment, configuring a platform
                to handle the mangement of site traffic, security and performance.
                They may even be responsible for developing the front end of the
                website according to designs supplied by a creative element of the
                project.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is in contrast to a web <i>designer</i> who would deal with the
                research and idea stages of any development project. They collaborate
                with stakeholders to translate research data, know-how and branding
                into visual blueprints of the final product.
            </p>

            <p>
                These definitions would apply in a corporate in-house web team or
                large website agency, but most would agree the lines are so
                blurred at a freelance level that the two are entirely
                interchangeable. The terms are also confused across the web making
                searching for the right website-professional a minefield for startups
                and business owners.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my experience, most people searching for website design services,
                are actually looking for a market researcher, a designer, a
                developer, a marketer and support agent but they either don't know
                it, or like most, assume it all comes packaged together.
            </p>

            <h3>Enter the Website Agency</h3>

            <p>
                A website agency does exactly that. It compiles a team of individuals
                who specialize in one or more of these skills (and the many I
                haven't noted) to provide a one-stop shop for your website needs.
                The downside, is an agency comes with the added overheads of a
                heated high-street office and employee benefits.
            </p>

            <p>
                Something else to consider; how many 9-5ers are passionate about
                what they do? I'm not suggesting none of them are, but it's
                reasonable to say there is room for anything from "I live for it!"
                right down to "it keeps the lights on".
            </p>

            <p>
                So what? As long as you get the website you pay for? As with
                anything that can be built, website development is a creative
                task, and whether it's a website, a house, or sandcastle, It's
                apparent when it's been built without enthusiasm.
            </p>

            <h3>Enter Jeff - The <i>Web Developer</i></h3>

            <p>
                So when people ask what I do, I prefer to introduce myself as a web
                developer. A person who designs, builds and maintains new or
                existing websites to help grow them into something better. I
                am the designer, the developer, marketer, the server
                engineer, the support team and all round website project wrangler.
            </p>


            <p> As a natural forward-thinker I’m a big advocate of cutting-edge tech
                and constantly seeking better solutions. I regularly collaborate and
                contribute solutions in the development community so I know when
                common practices should be avoided AND when not to reinvent the
                wheel.
            </p>

            <p> Responsive layouts, mobile-first code and SEO best practice is
                the default basis for all my projects. This means everything is
                designed to work on any device with any screen size, optimized for
                mobile first and adapted on the fly for larger screens as the code
                detects them. This means less loading time and no disruption caused
                by layout shifts as users in low bandwidth network areas are trying
                to access your website.

            <p> I’m armed with a wealth of real-world solutions and I love getting
                stuck in to projects big and small. I can build you a show-stopping
                website dripping with intricate animation when impact is required
                and I can implement clean, pixel-perfect user interfaces when
                clarity and ease of use is key.
            </p>

            <p> Pushing the web into the future is something I'm truly passionate
                about and I'd love for your website to be a part of it.
            </p>
