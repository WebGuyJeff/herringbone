				Exploring Human Interaction Through <span class="hardy">Website Design</span>
			</h2>
			<p>
				As a web <i>designer</i>, I deal with the research and idea stages of
				a development project. Working with stakeholders through a structured
				process to combine research data, branding and project goals to produce
				visual blueprints of the final product. Every aspect of the target-users
				needs must be considered to successfully inform the designs.
			</p>

				Connecting the Pieces With <span class="hardy">Website Development</span>
			</h2>
			<p>
				As a web developer, I write website and web app core systems. 
				Coding with an array of web programming languages, the components
				required to serve content and functionality are constructed. I 
				engineer a web hosting environment to serve the website and manage
				site traffic, security and performance. The front end is built and
				styled with a continuous develop and test cycle to ensure the interface
				is on-spec with the intended experience.

				Signposting and <span class="hardy">Website Marketing</span>
			</h2>
			<p>
				As an online marketer, I leverage web-based channels and search engine
				optimisation to help spread a message. Starting from the ground up,
				web pages are coded with semantically logical structure, meaningful
				linking and adoption of the Open Graph protocol for rich social media
				integration. I perform AND implement full technical SEO audits on
				existing sites. Paid advertising is used across Google, Bing, and
				social platforms to maximise outreach while organic content gains
				traction.

			<p> Iâ€™m armed with a wealth of real-world solutions and I love getting
				stuck in to projects big and small. I can build you a show-stopping
				website dripping with intricate animation when impact is required
				and I can implement clean, pixel-perfect user interfaces when
				clarity and ease of use is key.
			</p>

			<p> 
				Responsive layouts, mobile-first code and SEO best practice is
				the basis for all my projects. This means everything is
				designed to work on any device with any screen size. Optimised
				mobile-first for bandwidth-concious devices and adapted on-the-fly
				for larger screens as the code detects them. Decreased
				load-times and a smoother overall experience will increase user
				engagement and search engine rankings.

			<p> I'm always able to make time to look at new projects so if you have
				something you're looking for help with just send me a message. I can
				talk, video call, email or meet face to face, I'm very flexible!
