    <h2>Working With Me</h2>
    <p>Successful websites are influential, easy to use and effective sellers of the product or message. To get this right requires research, design, development, marketing, and hosting with a plan for support and development for the journey ahead. This list packs many skilled resources and is just the short version.</p>
    <p>By scaling down a development model I adopted as a website project manager in big-business eCommerce, I have a unique skill-set and big-industry knowledge making me the only contact you need for business website and cloud services.</p>
    <p>I am a designer, developer and marketer with the knowledge and experience to take your website design and development from start to finish, and continue to build as your business grows. Websites aren’t static portals of information, they are the breathing hub of the brand and business and should be part of a constant review and development cycle.</p>
    <p>One of the key benefits to a professionally built website is the handwritten code base is adaptable and expandable meaning you no longer throw your website away and start again every few years. Continued small projects of development after the initial build see your website grow in line with your business meaning it’s never left behind and it provides the exposure and opportunities your business needs to thrive. Big businesses know this and invest huge resources into aggressively developing their online service to stay ahead of their competition. I make this same continuous improvement available to small businesses and individuals with big ideas.</p>
    <p>My passion is website development and showing people how to utilize their online presence. It’s what I do night and day and while I’m not developing for a client, I’m collaborating with a global development community improving solutions and pushing the boundaries of modern WWW. I’m bursting with ideas and build everything as if it were my own. I code using platform-agnostic languages and to a strict style that makes everything I build conflict-free, stable and future-proof. I also extend website capability with advanced libraries some of which were developed by me. This allows me to add some show-stopping flare when you need to schmooze your users!</p>
