    <div class="column">
        <p> Everything I code is written in a squeaky clean style adopting the
            latest methods in CSS3, HTML5, PHP7+ and Javascript ES6 programming
            languages. If you're not a developer this likely
            means nothing to you, so here's a quote from American computer
            scientist Donald Knuth:

            <q> Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants
                the computer to do.</q>

            Clean code means a project can be easily expanded and adapted by any
            developer in the future, and perhaps more importantly, is more likely
            to be problem-free and easily debuggable when niggles arise. It’s
            important that we build something which is not only future-proof and
            robust, but extendable as your brand grows.
        </p>


        <p> I take you through the whole process from establishing your needs to
            launching your new website without making it complicated.
        </p>

        <p> I know how personal a website can be and what it means to feel good
            about this extension of your brand. At the very least it’s your
            online calling-card and at most, your entire business, product AND
            workforce. I am very attentive to client needs and always ensure
            complete satisfaction at every milestone of the project.
