# Herringbone

## A WordPress theme for my developer site and blog.

This theme is a stew of started ideas, half completed functionality and mini-projects that should be broken into plugins. It's half-cooked project which I intend to push to completion when time allows.

You are welcome to pick through and make use of what you can, but be warned it's not a well organized project at the moment.

Good Bits:

 - PHP classes are well organised and with autoloader.
 - Pretty solid menu walker.
 - 3 column responsive blog layout templates - needs styling to finish.

Bad bits:

 - The theme is completely unfinished and not useable without some work - I currently only use a single landing page from this project.
 - The template files are littered with content.
