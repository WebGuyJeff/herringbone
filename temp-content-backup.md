## Working With Me

There are many benefits to working with me, not least becauase it's just easy. Whether you're an established team looking for support from a developer or a solo-entrepenear bewildered by the confusing website market, I'm here to help.

### Complete Solution
By adapting a development model I adopted in high street retail and eCommerce, I provide a resourceful and complete solution to web development. I drive projects from conception to completion, from research and design to development and deployment and even provide hosting and support.

### Personal Service
I'll always be your direct point of contact, and getting to know you means we collaborate in a style that works best. The wonderful thing about people is we're all different. I aim to accommodate all and love learning about individual requirements, so I approach every challenge with your perspective in mind. I don't believe one size fits all, so I build bespoke solutions from the ground up wherever it adds value to your brand.

### Flexibility
As an experienced project manager, I foresee opportunities for improvement early on. Being an independent developer, I adapt quickly without the delay of meetings and sign-offs between teams. Your budget gets used efficiently, and I have the insight to provide solutions and keep milestones on target when running large projects.

### Experience
I've worked most roles in eCommerce, including being on the front line with customers, so I know first-hand the problems site owners and users face. Having a diverse development skillset means I know immediately what is possible and how best to apply your budget. My solutions are focused on the best outcome for all involved, keeping your customers happy and your business profitable.

### Value For Money
I code everything as if it were my own, following strict standards to ensure longevity and adaptability as your needs grow. Your website is an investment in your brand, and your audience will judge your credibility on it. I make sure your budget works hard to set you aside from the crowd, and with less spent on web agency overheads, there's more to put to work.

### Aftercare
I see my projects through for the long journey ahead, providing dedicated website hosting and technical support. I provide training and documentation where needed and perform ongoing maintenance to keep your website current. Part of that maintenance is keeping your website up to date with the latest technologies for optimum performance and security. It also means your website remains easily adaptable and compatible with add-on functionality, even if you decide to work with other developers.

## Get in Touch

I'm always able to make time to look at new projects so if you have something you're looking for help with, just send me a message. I can talk, video call, email or meet face to face, I'm very flexible!
